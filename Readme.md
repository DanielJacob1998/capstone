Project Idea: Program not only helps people with there pc but they can also include lets say finances, events stuff like that almost like if a calendar + file sizer + money combined into one

1. Feature Planning:

Identify the core features you want to implement. What's the primary functionality your app should provide?
Break these features down into smaller tasks or user stories.

2.Enhance Backend:

Think about the API endpoints needed to support your features.
Implement routes in Flask, and test them using tools like Postman or curl.

3. Database Integration:

Choose how to connect your application to a database and implement models.
If you're using SQLAlchemy, define your models and establish relationships as needed.

4. Frontend Development (if applicable):

Decide if you want to build a frontend using HTML/CSS/JavaScript or frameworks like React/Vue.js.
Develop basic UI components, keeping user experience in mind.

5. Iterative Development:

Implement one feature at a time, testing and refining your code as you go.
Regularly commit your code to Git with meaningful commit messages.

6. Testing and Debugging:

Write unit tests for important functionalities in your backend.
Debug any issues using logs or Flask's built-in debugger.

7. Documentation:

Regularly update your documentation (Readme.md) with instructions on how to set up, run, and test your application.
